# Hotel-Reviews

This is a Classification Project with sample dataset consisting customer reviews and rating given after their experience in the hotel.


Our goal is to examine how travelers are communicating their positive and negative experiences in online platforms for staying in a specific hotel and major objective is what are the attributes that travelers are considering while selecting a hotel. 


With this the hotel manager can understand which elements of their hotel influence more in forming a positive review or improves hotel brand image.
